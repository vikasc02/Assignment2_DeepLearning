Since the code is written and tested on Kaggle due to the availability of TPU for faster optimization and better integration of the huge dataset images, It is recommended to use Kaggle notebook for the processing of the models by inputing data can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phucthaiv02/butterfly-image-classification before running as it would add data without actually downloading it on your local and makes it convenient to compile and test.

Kaggle Notebook can be opened at: https://www.kaggle.com/code/
